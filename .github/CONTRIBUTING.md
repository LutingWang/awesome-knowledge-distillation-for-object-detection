# Contribution Guidelines

Youâ€™re more than welcome to contribute to the project!
To keep things organized and smooth, please follow these guidelines.

## Awesomeness

Awesome works in the field of detection KD are those with a strong influence.
That said, the field is still under rapid development, so newly published works with high potential are also acceptable, for example works from top conferences like CVPR.
Before adding a new work to the list, the awesomeness should be discussed in the pull request.

## Formatting

Each work should be formatted as below:

```md
Method Name. *Conf Year*.
[[paper](URL)]
\- Description

- Paper Title
- Author and Author
```

The rendered output should look like:

> Method Name. *Conf Year*.
> [[paper](URL)]
> \- Description
>
> - Paper Title
> - Author and Author

If the work does not have a `Method Name`, the field can be omitted.
A work can have multiple `paper` fields.
