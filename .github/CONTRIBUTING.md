# Contribution Guidelines

Youâ€™re more than welcome to contribute to the project!
To keep things organized and smooth, please follow these guidelines.

## Awesomeness

Awesome works in the field of detection KD are those with a strong influence.
That said, the field is still under rapid development, so newly published works with high potential are also acceptable, for example works from top conferences like CVPR.
Before adding a new work to the list, the awesomeness should be discussed in the pull request.

## Formatting

Each work should be formatted as below:

```md
MethodName. *ConfName YYYY*.
\[[source](URL)\]
<[repo](URL)>
\- Description

- Paper Title
- FirstName LastName and FirstName LastName
```

The rendered output should look like:

> KD. *NeurIPS 2015*.
> \[[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02531)\]
> \- Description
>
> - Distilling the Knowledge in a Neural Network
> - Geoffrey Hinton and Oriol Vinyals and Jeff Dean

If the work does not have a `MethodName`, the field can be omitted.
A work can have multiple `source` fields.
